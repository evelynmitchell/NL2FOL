Given a sentence, and the referring expressions of that sentence. Properties are anything that describe a relationship between two referring expressions, or it may describe a trait of a referring expression. These properties are essentially predicates in first-order logic.
Here are some examples of finding properties in a sentence:

Example 3: 
Input Sentence: “Mike doesn't believe in any gods.” 
Referring Expressions: Mike: x, Gods: y
Properties: Believe(x,y)
