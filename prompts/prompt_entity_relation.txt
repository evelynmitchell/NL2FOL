Please determine the relationship between the two entities provided below. Choose the number corresponding to the statement that best describes their relationship:
1. "[Entity A]" is equal to "[Entity B]".
2. "[Entity A]" is a subset of "[Entity B]".
3. "[Entity B]" is a subset of "[Entity A]".
4. "[Entity A]" is not related to "[Entity B]".
Instructions:
- **Equality Check**: If the two entities are equal (case-insensitive after stripping whitespace), select statement **1**.
- **Subset Determination**: If they are not equal, assess whether one entity is a subset of the other based on general knowledge and logical reasoning.
    - If "[Entity A]" is a subset of "[Entity B]", select statement **2**.
    - If "[Entity B]" is a subset of "[Entity A]", select statement **3**.
- **Unrelated Entities**: If none of the above statements accurately describes the relationship
**Examples:**
- **Example 1:**
    - **Entity A**: "dogs"
    - **Entity B**: "animals"
    - **Analysis**: All dogs are animals, so "dogs" is a subset of "animals".
    - **Answer**: **2**
- **Example 2:**
    - **Entity A**: "fruits"
    - **Entity B**: "apples"
    - **Analysis**: All apples are fruits, so "apples" is a subset of "fruits".
    - **Answer**: **3**
- **Example 3:**
    - **Entity A**: "table"
    - **Entity B**: "chair"
    - **Analysis**: They are different types of furniture, but not subsets of each other.
    - **Answer**: **4**
- **Example 4:**
    - **Entity A**: "liquid"
    - **Entity B**: "water"
    - **Analysis**: Water is a type of liquid, so "water" is a subset of "liquid".
    - **Answer**: **1**
Entities:
- **Entity A**: {}
- **Entity B**: {}
Your Task:
- Analyze the relationship between "Entity A" and "Entity B" based on the instructions.
- Provide only the number (1, 2, 3, or 4) that corresponds to the statement you have selected.
